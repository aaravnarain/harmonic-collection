            Identity is a very fluid and complex notion, something that is ever-changing. When I look back at myself, I can see clear 
            changes in my sense of identity but find it hard to point out an exact moment or event that led to these changes. This webpage 
            aims to provide a unique and immersive experience, exploring the evolution of individuals' sense of identity through pixelated 
            visuals.

            The central element of the website is a pixelated photo booth, where users can capture their own pictures and use them as prompts 
            for mindful reflection about our sense of identity. We often try to look at old pictures to compare how we looked/felt compared to 
            the present, but by blurring direct visual elements, the viewer is encouraged to focus on the more implicit changes.

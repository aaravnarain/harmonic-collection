               <a href= " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiraeth"; style="color: darkred;"> Hiraeth</a> is a Welsh word that has no direct English translation. It is likened to a homesickness tinged with grief and sadness over the lost or departed, especially in the context of Wales and Welsh culture. It is a mixture of longing, yearning, nostalgia, wistfulness or an earnest desire for the Wales of the past. In the modern world, Hiraeth is often used to refer to a longing for a home or place that once existed or that is not accessible anymore. </h3>

            Each time I moved, it would take me time to adjust to my new 
            surroundings and get over the familiar comfort of my previous home. 
            I have very fond memories of my grandmothers house in Lucknow 
            where I lived till I was 5, I miss the garden and the courtyard and 
            the park next to our house. 
            Unfortunately, that house has since been broken down and a commercial 
            building has taken its place. I often go back to the site of the old 
            house when I am visiting, reminiscing on my fond memories and feeling 
            what is perhaps best described by the word - hiraeth
            
            When I was living abroad in Sri Lanka and Kenya, I found a sense of comfort in my 
            apartment and my room. I kind of find it weird thinking how someone else could be 
            living there now.. How my home could be someone elses home now.. 
            When I found this word on Pinterest, it was somehow comforting and beautiful 
            (and has now become a part of my vocabulary and a recurring topic for my projects haha)</pre>

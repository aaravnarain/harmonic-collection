        <h3>Whenever I feel stressed or need to just take a breather, I love going near water bodies. I don’t know what it is about being around water,
             but it always manages to instantly calm me down. I wonder if it is because I’ve spent a good chunk of my life living next to the ocean, where I could see the waves 
             from my room’s window or if this has been a constant throughout my life. I find looking at waves or any sort of movements in water very grounding, and these movements accompanied 
             by the sounds of water create an almost meditative environment for me.</h3>

        <h3>I knew that many people around me felt the same feeling of relaxation when around water, and I wondered if there was any particular answer to this,
             leading me to find out about the concept of Biophilic Connection. Humans have an innate affinity for nature, a concept known as biophilia. This connection to natural 
             elements like water can evoke a sense of comfort and peace. The presence of water often triggers positive emotional responses and a sense of well-being. The sight of water 
             can evoke feelings of nostalgia, triggering memories of enjoyable experiences near water bodies, which further enhances the calming effect. Additionally, studies have shown 
             that being near water can lower cortisol levels, a stress-related hormone, and promote relaxation. The negative ions produced near water bodies have also been linked to an 
             increase in serotonin levels, which can elevate mood and reduce stress.</h3>
